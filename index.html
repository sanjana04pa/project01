        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">According to the American Express 2017 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report, women owned 39 percent of all privately held US firms, but those businesses contributed to just 4.2 percent of revenues. These figures demonstrate the necessity to reassess support for female entrepreneurs, writes Girl Scouts USA CEO Sylvia Acevedo. She argues that addressing inequality must begin with a focus on young girls. Acevedo expresses the need to provide girls with courage and confidence as well as business and technology-focused education to foster creative problem solving and leadership. </p>

            Gender equality underpins all of World Vision’s work – and there are many great activities you can get involved in to support the rights of women in developing countries.
           1.Sponser a girl: When you sponsor a girl, you can give her the tools to gain an education and take back the rights she deserves. This is a key way that girls can be empowered to grow up and influence their generation – and the next.
           2.Educate yourself by finding out about issues that affect girls – for instance, child marriage.
           3.Learn about what World Vision is doing to make change. Read more about our approach to helping girls escape gender inequality.
           4. Buy women’s empowerment gifts. World Vision offers a variety of gifts that contribute to investing in and building up women and girls.  </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> I love the Shine Theory, which is the idea that when you help another woman rise, we all shine. “Build other women up! If you see your co-worker doing a great job, give them credit…tell your boss or other co-workers,” says Rebecca Wiser, cofounder and director of communications at Womaze, an app centered around self-empowerment for women. “At first it may seem like you’re taking attention away from yourself, but you’re actually showing that you’re a supportive team player as well as an inspiring leader—and secure enough in yourself to praise others.” </p>
